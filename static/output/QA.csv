"3. How has the international community's efforts in reducing extreme poverty and hunger over the past 15 years been described, and what is the current status of extreme poverty and hunger globally?","Over the past 15 years, the international community's efforts in reducing extreme poverty and hunger have been described as successful. In 2000, the world committed to halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015, and this goal was met. Additionally, hunger has dropped by almost half in the past 20 years. Many countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet the nutritional needs of their most vulnerable people.

However, despite these achievements, the current status of extreme poverty and hunger globally is still concerning. More than 800 million people around the world still live on less than $1.25 a day, and nearly 1 out of every 9 people on earth go to bed hungry every night."
